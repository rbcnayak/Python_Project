# Python_Project
## Project Objective
To conduct an initial data and exploratory analysis to uncover sales patterns. The goal is to derive insights and suggest strategies for improved segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions

- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

- The company has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

## Stakeholders

**Vice President of Marketing**: “We’re always looking into improving our targeting for ad campaigns.”
**Senior Vice President of Sales**: “We need to know what part of our offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, we could improve this sector and boost sales.”
**Customer**: “I want to receive ads, promotions, and recommendations that are relevant to the products I order regularly.”
